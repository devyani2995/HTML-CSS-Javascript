       /*
        Conclusion:
             Every function while executing has a reference to its current execution
             context, which can be referenced by 'this'. This execution context gets created
             when a function is called. Therefore the value of ‘this’ inside a function depends
             on how and where the function is called.

             Implicit Binding => implicitly decides the value of ‘this’.
             Explicit Binding => explicitly specifies what the value of ‘this’ will be.
             New Keyword => ‘this’ takes up the value of a newly created object which refers
              to another object. This other object refers to the prototype of
              the function being called.
             Default binding => when none of the above rules applies, the ‘this’ takes the
              value of the window objec
